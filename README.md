## Info

This bot was created to help bridge the gap in understanding between aspiring modders and seasoned ones on the SRB2 Discord guild. I'm hopeful it'll be able to accomplish this over time.

The code is written in C#, on .NET 5.0, using the [DSharpPlus] Discord API wrapper.

Happy searching! —ash
